# Scum Studios Azure Kinect Volumetric Capture Tools

A set of tools to record and process point clouds from multiple Azure Kinect cameras.

## Prerequisites (Installation instructions below)

- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 or derivatives. Our test environment is Linux Mint 20.3.
- Azure Kinect SDK
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Python Open3D library


### Azure Kinect SDK Linux Installation & Configuration

Ubuntu 20.04 & Derivatives:

SDK: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/sensor-sdk-download#linux-installation-instructions

Direct links to 18.04 .deb (can be installed on 20.04):
- K4A SDK: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/libk/libk4a1.4/libk4a1.4_1.4.1_amd64.deb
- K4A Tools: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/k/k4a-tools/k4a-tools_1.4.1_amd64.deb
- Body Tracking SDK: https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod/pool/main/libk/libk4abt1.1/libk4abt1.1_1.1.2_amd64.deb

Copy '99-k4a.rules' into '/etc/udev/rules.d/' to access the cameras as non-root user. [Reference Azure Kinect SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md#linux-device-setup)

For Ubuntu 22.04, libsoundio1 is no longer in the repos and is required for the K4A SDK, you can install the [.deb from 20.04](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/libs/libsoundio/libsoundio1_1.1.0-1_amd64.deb) first at your own risk, then follow the same instructions for Ubuntu 20.04.


### Python Open3D

Open3D can be installed through the Python package manager (pip).

Install pip: ```sudo apt install python3-pip```

Install Open3D: ```pip install open3d``` (Make sure Open3D is version 0.17 or later)

To ensure compatibility it's best to install Open3D 0.17 by running ```pip install --trusted-host www.open3d.org -f https://storage.googleapis.com/open3d-releases-master/python-wheels/open3d-0.17.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.whl open3d```

Additionally, the ```python-is-python3``` package can be installed on older versions of Ubuntu if you would like your ```python``` command to default to python3. Do so at your own risk.

## Usage Guide

*Scripts are currently heavily in development, so this process and the output will (hopefully) change for the better in the future.*

#### record.sh (step 1: acquisition)

Shell script that uses the "k4arecorder" from the K4A Tools to automate the recording of multiple synchronized video & depth streams.
Run the script and follow along with the steps to start the recording. Assumes multiple Azure Kinects synced with sync cables.
Change the ```tilix``` exec to whichever terminal emulator you prefer to spawn the recording threads.

#### mkv2ply.py (step 2: conversion)

Python script that uses the Azure Kinect library in Open3D to process the mkv files created by the record script.
Currently processes and entire directory of mkv files and dumps out a .ply pointcloud per frame per file to /tmp for testing purposes. This is anything but optimized, hoping to streamline this process to generate an Alembic cache per video stream instead.
